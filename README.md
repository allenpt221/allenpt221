# Hi there 👋, I'm Patrick Allen 

## 🚀 About Me
I specialize in building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. My experience with both PERN and MERN stacks allows me to create scalable back-end architectures while delivering smooth front-end experiences. Using Next.js, I develop performant, SEO-friendly web applications, combining modern frameworks with efficient database management.

- 💻 Full-stack developer
- 🌱 Currently learning NextJs & python - django

## 🛠️ Experience  
Most of my experience comes from building and maintaining 'personal websites and portfolio projects'.  
- 🌐 Designed and developed multiple 'responsive personal websites' using 'Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS'.  
- ⚡ Focused on performance optimization and accessibility while building.  
- 🔗 Connected my projects with external **APIs** (GitHub, and custom backends) to make them more dynamic.  
- 🚀 Learned how to structure projects, manage state, and deploy apps on **Vercel** and **Render**.  

These projects have helped me **solidify my full-stack fundamentals** and prepared me to take on real-world applications.
