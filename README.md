# Hi there 👋, I'm Patrick Allen 

## 🚀 About Me
- 💻 Full-stack developer
- 🌱 Currently learning TypeScript & python - django
\
## 🛠️ Experience  
Most of my experience comes from building and maintaining **personal websites and portfolio projects**.  
- 🌐 Designed and developed multiple **responsive personal websites** using **Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS**.  
- ⚡ Focused on **performance optimization and **accessibility** while building.  
- 🔗 Connected my projects with external **APIs** (GitHub, and custom backends) to make them more dynamic.  
- 🚀 Learned how to structure projects, manage state, and deploy apps on **Vercel** and **Render**.  

These projects have helped me **solidify my full-stack fundamentals** and prepared me to take on real-world applications.
